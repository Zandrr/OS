arch/x86/kernel/helloworld.c
This is just a C file that has an asmlinkage reference from linux/linkage.h. Then it has a system call function that will print out a given line with the KERN_EMERG emergency macro.


arch/x86/kernel/Makefile
Added the line so that it will compile the object file of helloworld.c and link it.

arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.tbl
Here we add a system call and link it with a certain number that can be accessible.

include/linux/syscalls.h
Add the prototype to link it to the system call.

/var/log/syslog
This is where the system logs all outputs, and is where out output should be.

test.c
We use this to call the syscall function. We saved the syscall with the number 314, thus we call that then it will print whatever is in sys_helloworld.
	To run/compile test.c, type 'gcc test.c -o test' when in the kernels folder
